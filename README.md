# UI-Jackal-II
The UI Jackal II is a low-cost, modular quadruped robot designed for research in biomimetic legged locomotion. Lightweight, mechanically robust, and priced under $1,000, it provides a platform for autonomous navigation, heavy payload delivery, and experimentation on unstructured terrains. The project aims to make advanced robotics accessible to researchers in resource-limited settings, particularly in Africa.

üåç Motivation

While quadruped robotics research has advanced in North America, Europe, and Asia, many institutions in Africa face financial and resource barriers. The UI Jackal II seeks to empower these institutions by providing:

1. An affordable, replicable platform for research

2. Hands-on opportunities in dynamic locomotion and robotics

3. A foundation for local innovation and contribution to global robotics

üõ† Problem Statement

Challenges addressed by UI Jackal II include:

1. High cost of advanced legged robots (e.g., MIT Cheetah, Boston Dynamics Spot)

2. Lack of accessible quadruped platforms in Africa

3. Limited documentation, CAD designs, and electronics implementation in previous efforts (UI Jackal I)

üéØ Objectives

1. Affordable Design (< $1000): Off-the-shelf components to reduce costs

2. Heavy Payload Delivery: Transport loads across difficult terrains

3. Autonomous Navigation: Gather accurate topographic data in unstructured environments

4. Modularity & Scalability: Easily upgradeable and adaptable for various research needs

üèó Design Philosophy

1. Modular: Easy to customize and upgrade

2. Lightweight: Simple to deploy and maintain

3. Mechanically Robust: Durable for rough terrains and extreme conditions

4. Affordable: Enables research in resource-limited environments without sacrificing functionality

üîß Key Features

1. Quadruped locomotion for unstructured terrains

2. Low-cost, off-the-shelf components

3. Platform for experimentation in robotics and AI

4. Designed to be replicable and extensible

# Proof-of-Concept Prototype: UI Mini Jackal
Prior to the development of the UI Jackal II, an initial smaller prototype, the UI Mini Jackal, was created as a proof of concept. This smaller-scale design allowed for early testing and validation of key mechanical and control principles, significantly informing the larger-scale development of the UI Jackal II. This design was based on Aaed Musa's ARES robot found here: https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printed-Robot-Dog/
