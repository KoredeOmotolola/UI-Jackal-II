# Proof-of-Concept Prototype: UI Mini Jackal
Prior to the development of the UI Jackal II, an initial smaller prototype, the UI Mini Jackal, was created as a proof of concept. This smaller-scale design allowed for early testing and validation of key mechanical and control principles, significantly informing the larger-scale development of the UI Jackal II. This design was based on Aaed Musa's ARES robot found here: https://www.instructables.com/3D-Printed-Robot-Dog/
