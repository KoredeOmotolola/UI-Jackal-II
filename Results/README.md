# PERFORMANCE OF THE UI JACKAL II

## Higher Torque for Faster and More Precise Movement
The F37490 actuators in the UI Jackal II deliver 35 kg.cm of torque, significantly enhancing joint movement speed and accuracy. This higher torque enables smoother transitions between gaits and motion patterns, ensuring better locomotion efficiency. Additionally, the increased force output allows the UI Jackal II to handle heavier loads and execute dynamic movements without compromising stability.

## Enhanced Maneuverability
With 12 degrees of freedom (DOF), the UI Jackal II achieves greater articulation and natural movement patterns. This expanded range of motion allows for smoother movement transitions, enabling the quadruped to dynamically adjust its posture based on terrain conditions and operational requirements. The systemâ€™s improved flexibility supports complex gaits such as trotting, galloping, and directional shifts with high precision.

## Improved Stability on Uneven Terrain
The combination of enhanced actuator strength and refined motion control makes the UI Jackal II well-suited for real-world environments, including rough and inclined terrains. FEA analysis confirms that the structure maintains stability under high dynamic loads, preventing excessive vibration or instability. The design improvements ensure consistent performance across varying surfaces without the need for additional stabilization measures.

## Optimized Gait Execution for Real-World Applications
The higher torque output and multi-DOF system enable the UI Jackal II to execute a variety of quadrupedal gaits with fluid motion. The actuator control system allows real-time adjustments, providing adaptive movement responses based on environmental conditions. These enhancements make the UI Jackal II ideal for applications requiring precise mobility, such as robotic research, surveillance, and autonomous navigation.

# OBJECTIVE PERFORMANCE TESTING
Performance testing for the UI Jackal II focused on two primary objectives: **Heavy Payload Delivery** and **Autonomous Site Mapping**. These objectives were established to evaluate the quadruped's ability to operate effectively in real-world environments where wheeled robots face limitations. The tests assessed improvements in payload capacity, structural resilience, and autonomous functionality, ensuring the UI Jackal II meets its intended design goals.

## Heavy Payload Delivery

### Increased Load Capacity
Equipped with F37490 actuators, each providing 35 kg.cm of torque, the UI Jackal II delivers significantly improved force output, enabling it to handle heavier payloads without performance degradation. This enhancement ensures reliable transport of materials across challenging terrains.

### Enhanced Structural Integrity
The multi-material frame, incorporating PLA, TPU, PVC, and rubber, optimizes mechanical strength while maintaining controlled flexibility in high-stress regions. This combination allows for improved durability under heavy loads.

### Verified Structural Endurance
Finite Element Analysis (FEA) results confirm that the maximum stress levels remain well within safe operational limits, preventing structural failure during high-load applications. These advancements make the UI Jackal II well-suited for tasks such as industrial logistics, search-and-rescue operations, and autonomous delivery missions.

## Autonomous Navigation

### Advanced Sensor Integration
The UI Jackal II is equipped with a comprehensive sensor suite, including four touch sensors, an IMU module, and twelve 360-degree rotary encoders. These sensors enhance environmental awareness, enabling adaptive decision-making in real time.

### Improved Terrain Adaptability
With 12 degrees of freedom (DOF), the UI Jackal II ensures smooth traversal over rough and inclined surfaces, minimizing navigation errors and maintaining balance under variable conditions.

### High-Performance Computational System
Powered by a Raspberry Pi 5, the system delivers greater computational power, ensuring real-time data processing and precise control over autonomous movement. This upgrade allows the UI Jackal II to efficiently execute mapping and reconnaissance tasks with minimal human intervention.

With these advancements, the UI Jackal II achieves autonomous navigation with enhanced precision and reliability, making it ideal for applications in scientific research, urban planning, industrial inspections, and military operations.
